## If pooled connection not used for a timeout time and current connections amount bigger than minimum idle connections pool size, then it will closed and removed from pool. Value in milliseconds.
  idleConnectionTimeout: 10000
## Timeout during connecting to any Redis server.
  connectTimeout: 10000
## Redis server response timeout. Starts to countdown when Redis command was succesfully sent. Value in milliseconds.
  timeout: 3000
## Error will be thrown if Redis command can't be sended to Redis server after retryAttempts. But if it sent succesfully then timeout will be started.
  retryAttempts: 3
## Time interval after which another one attempt to send Redis command will be executed. Value in milliseconds
  retryInterval: 1500
## Password for Redis server authentication
  password: null
## Subscriptions per subscribe connection limit. Used by RTopic, RPatternTopic, RLock, RSemaphore, RCountDownLatch, RClusteredLocalCachedMap, RClusteredLocalCachedMapCache, RLocalCachedMap, RLocalCachedMapCache objects and Hibernate READ_WRITE cache strategy.
  subscriptionsPerConnection: 5
## Name of client connection
  clientName: null
